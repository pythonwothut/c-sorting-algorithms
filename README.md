This repository contains simple implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms in C language:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**

| File Name              | Algorithm           | Description                                      |
|------------------------|-------------        |--------------------------------------------------|
| `bubble sort.c`        | Bubble Sort         | Optimized with early termination (swapped flag) |
| `selection sort.c`     | Selection Sort      | Finds minimum element in each pass              |
| `insertion sort.c`     | Insertion Sort      | Builds sorted array one element at a time       |
## How to Compile and Run

Open terminal/command prompt in the folder and run:

```bash
# For Bubble Sort
gcc bubble sort.c -o bubble
./bubble

# For Selection Sort
gcc selection sort.c -o selection
./selection

# For Insertion Sort
gcc insertion sort.c -o insertion
./insertion
