# C 2D Arrays - Full Tutorial Code  
**CBSE Class 11/12 | DSA | College Beginners in C**

This repository contains simple implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms in C language:
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**

For a detailed visual explanation and implementation walkthrough of these sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort) in C programming, check out this helpful YouTube video:

| `selection sort.c`     | Selection Sort      | Finds minimum element in each pass               |
| `insertion sort.c`     | Insertion Sort      | Builds sorted array one element at a time        |
## How to Compile and Run(for Beginners)
1. Click the green **Code** button (top-right of this page)
2. Click **Download ZIP**
3. Extract (unzip) the folder to any location on your computer
